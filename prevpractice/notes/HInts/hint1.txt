A Hint!
In the next lecture, we'll write this code:

module.exports = path.dirname(process.mainModule.filename);
(I explain why we write this code in the next lecture when we write it!)

The important thing is that you might get a deprecation warning for that code - in that case, you can simply switch to this code:

module.exports = path.dirname(require.main.filename);
Quite straightforward :)
